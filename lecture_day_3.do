** Before reading this pre-reading dofile, you need to do following things

// (1) - save this dofile into "assignment_1" folder with "stud_do" inside shared dropbox folder and add your name in your own dofile.
// (2) - change directory path based on your PC folder arrangement


// set your directory here

** (I): EXAMINING THE DATA **

sysuse census


** (1) LIST **

list state region pop

list _all

list *

// Subsetting the data (if and in qualifiers)

list state region pop in 10/15

//list state region pop in -1/2

/*
byte 	: integer between -127 and 100 e.g. dummy variable
int 	: integer between -32,767 and 32,740 e.g. year variable
long 	: integer between -2,147,483,647 and 2,147,483,620 e.g. population data 
float 	: real number with about 8 digits of accuracy e.g. production output data 
double 	: real number with about 16 digits of accuracy

** (2) BROWS / EDIT **

brows

brows state region pop
brows state region pop in 10/15
brows state region pop if state == "Georgia"


// The difference with edit is that this allows you to manually change the dataset.
edit

edit state region pop
edit state region pop in 10/15
edit state region pop if state == "Georgia"


** (3) ASSERT **
// With large datasets, it often is impossible to check every single observation using list or browse. 
// Stata has a number of additional commands to examine data which are described in the following. 
// A first useful command is assert which verifies whether a certain statement is true or false. 
// For example, you might want to check whether all population (pop) values are positive as they should be:
// If the statement is true, assert does not yield any output on the screen. If it is false, number of contradictions.

assert pop>0
//assert pop<0


** (4) DESCRIBE **
